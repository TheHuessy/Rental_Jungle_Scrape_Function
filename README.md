# Rent_Jungle_Scrape_Function
A simple web scraper that takes info from a table RentJungle.com, parses it, and appends it to a csv.

This function is somewhat interactive. It will prompt the user to input information such as save location of the file output and whether or not they think the data look correct.

This function was a very early tool I made and serves merely as a code example and/or reference material for people looking for help with readlines() and text parsing.
